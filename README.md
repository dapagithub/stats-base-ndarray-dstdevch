## 📈 Using the Application

After installing the application, you can start using it to compute the standard deviation.

1. Open the application.
2. You will see a simple interface that allows you to input your data.
3. Enter your one-dimensional data points in the designated field. Make sure to separate values with commas.
4. Click on the "Calculate" button.
5. The application will display the standard deviation of your input data.

## 📜 Example

Here’s an example of how to use the application:

- Input: `2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5`
- Click "Calculate."
- Output: `1.1180` (This is the standard deviation for the provided data).

## 📃 Features

- **Simple Interface:** Easy to use, even for beginners.
- **One-Pass Algorithm:** Fast computation without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Supports Double-Precision:** Handles large numbers efficiently.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation means the values are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means the values are spread out over a wider range.
- **One-Pass Algorithm:** This technique allows the application to compute results in a single pass through the data, improving efficiency.

## 🔗 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the application, here are some common solutions:

- **Application Won’t Start:** Make sure your operating system is supported. Check the system requirements again.
- **Wrong Results:** Ensure that your input values are correctly separated by commas and are valid numbers.
